# Biosensor Machine Learning Model

This project predicts the absorption peak frequency of a metasurface-based SPR biosensor using polynomial regression.

## Folder Structure

- `data/`: Contains the mock sensor data.
- `output/`: Stores the model evaluation and prediction plot.
- `sensor_ml_model.py`: Main script to run the ML model.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/biosensor-ml.git
   cd biosensor-ml
